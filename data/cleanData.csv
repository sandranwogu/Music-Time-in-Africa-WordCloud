REGGREENGS HELL PLAY FOR US  THANK YOU RITA AND JUST AS YOU ALREADY SAID THE BOWLLYRE INDEED DOES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF EXISTENCE ESPECIALLY IN NORTHEASEERN AND EASTERN AFRICAN CULTURES EGYPTIAN PAINTINGS ABOUT 2000 YEARS BC SHOW MUSUETINS PLAYING LYRES HISTORIANS SAY THAT THE LYRE WAS INTRODUCED INTO EGYPT BY Ac 2 SEMITIC NOMADS RENE HISTORIANS ALSO NOTED THAT EGYPTIAN TRADERS HAD ALREADY PENETRATED THE REGIONS OF SUDAN AND EAST AFRICA As EARLY AS 2275 BC SO MUSIC HISTORIANS ASSUME THAT THE TRAVELERS BROUGHT MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS WITH THEM DURING MIGRATIONS INTO THOSE REGIONS ANDDOWN AS FAR AS LAKE VICTORIA PERHAPS THE MOST COMMON USAGE OF THE BOWLLYRE Is IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PRAISE SONGS MOST OF WHICH ARE XNRRUYXE IMPROVISED ON THE SPOT WHETHER PRAISE SINGING IS IN WEST EAST CENTRAL OR SOUTH AFRICA THE SONGS ARE BEHALLY ABOUT IMPORTANT PEOPLE EVEN GLORIFYING THEM ALTHOUGH MUSICIANS ALSO SING ABOUT CERTAIN EVENTS AND IMPORTANT HAPPENINGS WHHT ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF LEO WHAT IS IT FIRST OF ALL THE INSTRUMENT IS A WOODEN BOWL COVERED WITH COWHIDE OR ZEBRA SKIN IT HAS TWO WOODEN ARMS ATTACHED TO THEFACE OF THE INSTRUMENT IN THE SHAPE OF A v AND A WOODEN BAR CONNECTS THE TWO ARMS AT THE TOP STRINGS ARE STRUNG FROM THE CROSS BAR DOWN ACROSS THE FACE OF THE BOWL AND EACH STRING HAS ITS OWN TUNING KNOT ON THE CROSS BAR THE KNOTS ARE MADE OF STRING AND CLOTH AND ITS AMAZING HoquLL THIS TUNING SYSTEM WORKS AND CAN KEEP THE INSTRUMENT IN TUNE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME ITS ALSO INTERESTING THAT THE STRINGS ARE STRETCHED OVER TWO BRIDGES  A REAL ONE AND A FALSE ONE THE REAL BRIDGE IS PLACED AT THE FOOT OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THE FALSE BRIDGE USUALLY A FLAT PIECE OF CANE IS PLACED AT THE CENTER OF THE FACE SO THAT IT PRODUCES A BUZZING SOUND WHEN THE XMSIIMMEN STRINGS ARE PLUCKEDz CUT THREE 10 SECS  THAT BUZZING OR RATTLING SOUND IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE INSTRUMENT IS WELLMADE AND IS BEING WELLPLAYED BOWLLYRES ARE MADE IN VARYING SIZES AND WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF STEEXNESE STRINGS FOR INSTANCE IN KENYA THE LARGE OBUKANO OF THE KISII HAS TWELVE STRINGS THE LITUNGU EXEHZKEERXNESX A MEDIUM SIZE INSTRUMENT HAS EIGHT

IN HISTORY Do WE GO WHEN TALKING ABOUT EEEIOPIAN MUSIC LEO WELL FIRST ID LIKE To MENTION THAT WHATEVER INFORMATION WE HAVE HERE ABOUT 1 ETHIOPIAN MUSIC COMES FROM MY COLLEAGUE SHENAFI KEBEDE WHO IS AT THE PRESENT TIME DIRECTOR OFD THE CENTER FOR BLACK CULTURE AT FLORIDA STSATE UNIVERSITY HES ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK ROOTS OF BLACK MUSIC ASHENAFI TELLS US THAT EHTIOPIAN WRITINGS REVEAL THAT IN THE SECOND MILLENIUM DC 5 THAT IS TWO THOUSAND YEARSSBEFORE CHRIST IMMIGRANT CUSHITES HAD ALREADY SETTLED IN ETHIOPIA AND DURING THE FIRST MILLENIUM DC A RACE OF PEOPLE FROM SOUTH WEST ARABIA HAD SETTLED IN THE W NORTHERN REGION OF PRESENT DAYr 3 MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA FEB9 1986 866 PAGE TWO  ETHIOPIA THE LANGUAGE OF THOSE EARLY SETTLERS WAS GEEZ WHICH IS STILL THE LANGUAGE OF THE ETHIOPIAN CHURCH DURING THE FIRST CENTURY AD THERE WAS A POWERFUL EMPIRE KNOWN As THE AXUMITE EMPIRE FAMOUS TEMPLES AND PALACES AND  OTHER REMAINS SUCH AS COINS AND METALS BEAR WITNESS TO THE PRESENT DAY A GREAT w TECHNICAL SKILL AND ADVANCENEET IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION HERE THAT ON THE AFRICAN CONTIBBBT EEKIOPIA ALONE with the exception of the arabian countries HAD A SCRIPT AND WRITING SYSTEM OF ITS OWN IN THE FOURTH CENTURY AD CHRISTIANITY WAS MADE THE yATE RELIGION OF THE AXUMITE EMPIRE THE DECLINE OF III AXUMITE EMPIRE BEGAN DURING THE SEVENTH CENTURY AD AND THERE WAS A PERIOD OF WAR AND UNREST THE ETHIOPIAN ORHTODOX CHURCH LEADERS THEN ATIEMPTED TO COMMUNICATE PRAYER THROUGH MUSIC THIS WAS ALSO A PERIODRELIGIOUS AND CIVIL WARS AS A RESULT OF THE RAPID GROWTH OF ISLAM so THERE WAS ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STYLE OF PATRIOTIC FOLK SONGS SISE BY SIDE WITH RELIGIOUS CHANTS AND DEVOTIONAL CHURCH MUSIC DURING THE 12TH CENTURY KING LALIBELA WAS THE MOST FAMOUS RULER IN ETHIOPIA AND IT IS SAID THAT HE ORGIIIZED A GUILD FOR MUSICIANS LIKE A MUSICIANSUNION WE HAVE NOWADAYS IN THE 13TH CENTURY AMHARIC WHICH WAS ONCE A DIALECT OF THE ANCIENT GEEZ LANGUAGE BECAME THE OFFICIAL COURT LANGUAGE ANSREMAINED AS THE LANGUAGE OF ETHIOPIA DURIING THE 17TH CENTURY THERE WAS A REVITALIZTION OF TRASDITIONAL RELIGIOUS ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS RRanxnxxxxnxxunxxxxERIExxxxxnxnxxxxxuauuxunxxxxxxxuxxxuuxuxxxx Exnxnxxxxxxxxuzxxxxxx AMONG THE VARIOUS MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN EIHIOPIA WHICH ONE IS THE MOST POPULAR AND BEST YOHANNES YOHANNES  m WELL I Wag SAY THAT THE KRAR IS PROBABLY THE BEST 53 KNOWN INSTRUMENT Aw RITA HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT WORD YOHANNES KRAR IT ACTUALLY MEANS STRINGED REFERRING To STRINGED INSTRUMENTS THE KRAR Is TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE AND USUALLY HAS SIX STRINGS THE SOUND Box IS USUALLY MADE FROM ANY TYPE OF METAL BOWL OR PAN COVERED OVER BY A SHEEP OR GOAT SKIN THE STRINGS OF THE KRAR TRADITIONALLY WERE GUT BUT NOHADAYS MANY KRARS USE NYLON WIRE OR SILK STRINGS AHIr   eRTt e A   ACTUALL THERE ARE NO  WAYS 0F PLAYING THE KRAR ONE BY MUTING THE STRINGS THE OLD TRADITIONAL WAY THE PLAYERS LEFT HAND RESTS 0 THE STRINGS TO DEADEN III OR MUFFLE THE IIIIII SOUND THE OTHER WAY TO PLAY THE KRAR WHICH IS THE PREFERRED WAY IS BY PLUCKING THE STRINGS IN THIS WAY THE MUSICIAN CAN CREATE HIGHLY ORNAMENTAL SOUND PATTERNS AND PRODUCE A ROMANTIC W SENSUOS AND EXPRESSIVE MOOD IN THE EXAMPLE WE HAVE HERE   iidkh  h A K Yohannes give name and describe musician etc      MUSIC CUT TWO 325 r in AAI MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA FEB9 1986 866 PAGE THREE   V8EHE OTHER IMPORTANT STRINGED INSTRUMENT IN ETHIOPIA IS THE MASINKO A TYPE 0F  M  FIDDLE PLAYED WITH A BOW THE ORIGIN OF THE MASINKO OF COURSE IS UNKNOWN BECAUSE IT IS PLAYED IN so MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE HORN OF AFRICA IN NORTH AFRICA AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THROUGHOUT ASIA THE SOUNDBOX OF THE MASINKO 13 OF WOOD AND FORMED IN A DIAMONDSHAPE THE BOXXIS COVERED WITH COWHIDE AND THE INSTRUMENT HAS ONE STRING AND THE STRINGS OF THE BOW ARE MADE FROM A STRANDS OF HORSE TAIL THE FIVE FINGERS OF THE LEFT HAND ARE ALL USED To CHANGE T THE TONE WHILE PLAYING A MELODY ACTUALLY  THE MASINKO IS USED FOR BOTH SECULAR  AND RELIGIOUS MUSIC INCLUDING THE PERFORMAHEE AND ACCOMPANIMENT Iii WAR SONGS KNOWN AS SHELELA MASINKo MUSIC IS ALMOST LIKE VOCAL MUSIC THE PLAYERS TRY TO IMITATE THE TONAL SPEECH PATTERNS OF THE HUMAN VOICE JUST To SHOW HOW SKILLFUL THEY ARE THIS EXAMPLE OF MASINKO PLAYING Is A VERY GOOD ONE BECAUSE  1 IT SHOWS A GREAT DEAL OF ORNAMENTATION TL MUSIC CUT THREE 2Eo Yfg RITA IN THIS ll ALBUM TITLED ORHCESTRA ETHIOPIA WHICH LEO RECORDED IN ADDIS ABABA  13 SOME YEARS AGO I LIKE THE SELECTION CALLED AMBASEL FEATURING THE WASHINT m  FLUTE  YOHANNES WELL

AFRICA AND IT TAKES ITS NAME FROM THE NIGER RIVER WHICH FLOWS THROUGH THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THEXEEHNT ITS TERRITORY AN INTERRSTING NOTE IS THAT THE NAME NIGER DERIVES FROM THE TAMASHEK LANGUAGE OF THE TUAREG PEOPLE THE WORD IS FROM A PHRASE MEANING RIVER AMONG RIVERS GEOGRAPHICALLY THE COUNTRY IS DESCRIBED AS BEING LANDLOCKED THAT IS IT HAS NO ACCESS TO THE SEA L 2 aKOTONINGaiMUSIC TIME IN AFRICA o

OF THE MYSTERIOUS AIR MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHWESTERN PART 0 F THE COUNTRY NIGER FORMS PART OF THE VAST SAHELIAN CULTURAL REGION OF WEST AFRICA AND LAYS CLAIM TO A SHARE IN THE PROUD HISTORIC HERITAGE OF THE WEST AFRICAN SUDAN REGION ALTHOUGH THE INFLUENCE OF ISLAM IS RR PREDOMINANT PREISLAMIC CULTURAL TRADITIONS ARE ALSO VERY STRONG END IN EVIDENCE EVERYWHERE AMONG THE NONnMIGRATING PEOPLES NF

INSTRUMENT ISA WOODEN STICK FIXED INTO THE SOUNDBOX UNDER THE SKIN AND THE STRINGS ARE STRETCHED OVER A BRIDGE UP TO THE TIP OE THE WOODEN POLE THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC THING ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT IS

VIRTUOSITY IN LUTE PLAYING CUT THREE 030 SECS ASIDE FROM THE POPULAR KHALAM YOU JUST HEARD ANOTHER IMPORTANT MUSICAL INSTRUMEN IN SENEGALESE TRADITIONAL MUSIC IS THE MAJESTIC WEST AFRICHN HARP CALLED

WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IQUSIC IN GHANA EU WITH ME IS MY COILEAGUE LEO SARKISIAN YOUR VOA MUSICMAN I THANK YOU RITA AND HELLO FRIENDS AS YOU KNOW FROM TIME TO TIME ITEVE FEATURED MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AND SINGING STYLES OF SOME OF T HE VARIOUS PEOPLES sneak music here IN GHANA  THE DRUNS OF adoWA HORNS AND FLUTES AND FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THIS MUSIC FOR adenteBEN CUT THREE 020 SECS ALSO AMONG THE MANY FOLK INSTRUMENTS IN GHANA THERE ARE MUSICAL BOWS RAFT ZITHERS HARPS BOWED AND PLUCKED LUTES CUT FOUR 020 SECS  j THERE ARE SOME MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS PLAYED ALONE AS SOLO INSTRUMENTS OR IN 3 ENSEMBLES HWEVER IT IS NOT UNCOMIEON IU FIND THEM COMBINED WI TH VOICE FOR EWLE EHERE IS SINGING THAT GOES WITH adoWA DRUMMING OR WITH agbaJA 3136333 A A FULL PEBFCRIIANCE OF ANY OF THESE WOULD INCLUDE BOTH paCHA aWA kamboWANG TO OF THE MUSICAL TYPES FOUND IN VARIOUS PARTS OF GHANA DRUMS AND VOICES AND PERHAPS BELLS 0R RATTLES OR BOTH CUT FIVE 031 SECS WHAT I SAID ABOUT DRUMS IS ALSO TRUE OF OTHER INSTRUMENTS IT IS USUAL FOR PERFORMEIIIM OF STRINGED INSTRUMENTS To SING As THEY ARE PLAYING IN SPITE OF THE FACT THET THE XYLOPHONE IS CAPABLE OF EXPLOITING BOTH RHYTHMEC AND MELODIC RESOURCES TO AN EQUALLI HIGH DEGREE ONE NOULD FIND IT NOW AND THEN SUPDORTING OR LEADING A CHORUS IT IS OBVIOUS THEREFORE FROM THE WIDESPREAD TENDENCY TO COMBINE INSTRUMENTS AND VOICES THAT VOCAL MUSIC HAS CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE IN LOCAL CULTURE AND DESERVES PARTICULAR ATTENTION IF ONE WISHES TO UNDERSTAND THE PRACTICE OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN GHANAIAN SOCIETIES THERE ARE MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA MU SI C  LEO VOICE  MUSIC LEO VOICE MUSIC i MAY 1 1983 8318 PAGE TINTE III 0 TA NT TxJOTHIIIGS THAT SHOULD BE COIICIDVJRIJD IN VOCAL MUSIC FIRST CONCERNING THE TUNE THE KIND OF SCALE IT USES THE KIND OF VOICE QUALITIES UEFD AND THE TECHNIQUES OF VOICE PRODUCTION OR THE KIND OF SINGING STYLE TIEETLOYED FOR EXAMPLE THE SINGING STYLE OF FRAFRA IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE AKAN   BOTH OF TIIEIE USE DI FERENT SCALES ANYOIIE TRAVELING IN GHANA WOULD IULET THIS EDRT OF THING IN DIFFERENT ARI S IT WOULDNT TAKE LONG TO RECOGNIZE DAGARTI SINGING AND DI STINGUISH IT FROM DAGBANI SINGING CR KONKOMBA SINGING SO IN VOCAL MUSIC THE TUNE POSES ITS OWN PROBLEIJS OF UNDERSTAIUDING ANB APPRECIATIDNN THESE PROBLEMS ARE SCIEMT INDEPENDENT OF THE PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE WHICH IS THE OTHER ASPECT W TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN TALKING ABOUT VOCAL MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MUSIC OF THE AREA IN GHANA THERE sneak music here HERE IS A RECORDING FROM THE ANGLO TUNGU ARE TWO DIFFERENT SINGING STYLES AREA CUT SIX 020 SECS NON LISTEN TO THIS RECORDING FRCIVI KPANDU AREA IN GHANA CUT SEVEN 018 SECS THE DIFFERENCE BETIJEEN THE TWO RECORDINGS YOU JUST HEARD IS NOT THE LANGUAGE THEY WERE PRACTICALLY THE SAFE  IF SDNEONE FROM THE HOKPANDU AREA FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO APPRECIATE ANGLO MUSIC IT WOULD BE ON MUSICAL GROUNDS THE VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE TONES THAT ARE SELECTED AND USED AS A BAS OF THE SONGS AND THE TYPICAL PATTERNS lIN WHICH THEY ARE USED 30 ALTHOUGH THE TWO GROUPS HAVE A COMMON SPOKEN LANGUAGE FOR SOCIAL PURPOSES WEN IT COMES TO MUSIC THEY USE DIFFERENT MUSICAL IANGUAGES THE OPPOSITE CASE NON OF GHANIANS WHO SPEAK DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT WHO SHARE A COMMON MUSICAL LANGUAGE FOR E viPLE LETS COMPARE THE MUSICAL LANGUAGE OF THE EWE OF THE HOKPANDU AREA AND THE MUSIC OF THE AKAN THE GHANG THE GA GR SPEAKERS OF NONEWE LANGUAGES IN THE EWE REGION SUCH m PLACES AS CENTRA KOVI JASSICA AND SO FORTH LISTEN TO THESE TWO RECORDINGS HERE IS THE FIRST ONE CUTEIGHT 020 SECS EWEh A HUIIC TITLE IN

ItUELJCAL LANGUAGTC u Ju RATHER SIMILAR OUR FIRST AIM THEN RUST RE TO ENLARGE OUR UNDERSTAIJDING OF THE IEUSICAL LANGUAGES OR INJSICAL IDIOMS 0R STYLES OF AFRICAN KUEIC SO THAT WHEN WE LISTEN To NUS1C DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN IT CAN GOIJMUNICATE SCANTHING TO US SOMETIENG HE CAN APPRECIATE EVEN THOUGH WE FAY NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORDS OF THESONG MEANS IiUSICIANS IN THEPAST MERE NOT ONLY POETS RHO EXPRESSED THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS IN THEIR SONGS THEY WERE CRITICS NHO GAVE OUT PRAISE OR BLAME BECAUSE THEY HERE SENSITIVE TO WHAT WENT ON ABOUT THEY HERE TO SOME EXTENT PEOPLE WEILVERSED IN THE TRADITIONS OF THEIR CULTURE AND THEY KNEW THE GENEAOLOGIES OF KINGS AND COULD RECITE THESE ON DRUMS OR SING THEM IN PRAISE POEMS OR MOURNFUL SONGS THEY HISTORIANS OF A SORT AND KEPT THE CHRONICLES OF THE STATE IN THE DAGOMBA AREA OF GHANA THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE KEPT THE ANCIENT TRADITIONS   THE DAGBANI GONJE PLAYERS AND SINGERS WHO CHANT TO THE RHYTHM OF HOURGLASS SHAPED DRUMS ARE STILL VERY GOOD AT THISAND So ARE THE HASTm DRUMMERS WHO PLAY THE FAIIOUS ATUMPAN DRUMS CUT TEN 020 SECS AND NON THIS FINAL EXAMPLE OF GHANAIAN MUSIC IS MUSIC FOR THE DANCE CALLED adoWA THE BASIC MOVEMENT OF THE

to visit today and its the musi of the Bembaspeaking people being featured The Babemba as the people are called live in the northern and Luapula regions of Zambia The Zambian writer Cajetan Lunsonga tells us in his notes  on the history of these pebple that the Bembaspeaking tribes seem  to have come from one principal stem and that as they came down i from the north they had to conquer others whom they met on the way When they reached the Luapula river some of the principal tribal chiefs decided to remain along the riVers valley while others pushed forward for a better settlement Ensuing tribal were brought about mixtures in language and cultural traditions In the musical traditions of the Babemba songs are divided into various sections depending on the types of festivals or occasions in the life cycle and time circle of these people There are songs for w  v birth of twins and on such occasions women especially perform a lot of dances and singing Singing and dancing take place for lSIC TIME IN AFRICA FEB  1970 f the coming of the childs first teeth and for the initiation page 2 ceremonies at the age of puberty There there are the marriage songs First for the wedding eve  when the days of waiting for th wedding day get less they start to prepare millet for making beer and all sorts of foods that would be required for the wedding People sing continuously during all these activities and then on a the wedding day the bride it taken separately from the groom to learn the ways of performing marriage They are not taught verbally but all is done through dances special songs and other traditional customs Beer drinking dances and singing take nhnn place when the newly married woman conceives and there iszpecial xungxminxug set of tunes sung during the preparations arranged for the arrival of a new baby As in most other parts of Africa there are the special funeral songs  both for before and after burial occasions In Bemba customs deaths are classified and special homage is paid to each type and there are songs also for the renewalofvillagefire ceremonies After burying all return to the village and clean their houses or smear them then take out everything and the fires are extinguished The Headman of that Village orders that no marriage activities be done that night With his village crafts he makes a new fire and all go to take from that new fire There are many more types of Bemba music like the songs for defeating a battle killing a lion crowning a chief and the music for different tribal dances but first lets listen to a medley of two pretty Memba tunes by Musonda and Simwinga old tunes recorded some years back but still nice to listen to  theyre love songs and of course about beautiful girls CUT 1 600 xMUSIC TIME IN AFRICA v v I VOICE f 143 v

general nmxhxmxhnnxmxhl Imiilgn work and entertainment in the village The beer drinking and party songs are endless Our Musicman Leo looked through his collection of Bemba music and found this

little xxx romantic the purpose is to entertain everyone 253 That was a folksong for the accompaniment of the Ndelema dance CUT 3 and the music was played on the llnote Mumamba mbira This next selection is from Kawamba  a song that usually accomapnies the Bemba stene game Players squat in a x32 circle and pass stones round from man to man Its very difficult to say uhnhhnxmthtlx

from the western part of the Ivory Coast  music of the Dan people who number about 200 thousand in the Ivory Coast and another 100 thousand across the border in Liberia where they are called Gio Most of the area where the Dan live is divided between equatorial forest and mountainous places where many peaks rise over 2000 feet The Dan like all West African forest dwellers are planters Their chief nourishment is is rice which they grow on steep slopes Meat is not eaten very much as domettic animals like chickens sheep goats and cattle are only slaughtered for special faith feasts So hunting and fishing are pretty important if theres to be any meat eaten at all In the early days each headman of a Dan village had a number of musicians on his personal staff Trained  singers drummers and

in all kinds of festivities and our first number today is performed by hust such a group It consists of ten singers One soloist alternates with a second who breaks in with loud interruptions The other eight forming a chorus keep repeating the same motif A ratlle made from a calabash and two chains of brass rings accompany the singing MUSIC CHIEFS SONG Cut 1 400 VOICE That was music for a chief by singers of the Dan tribe in the western part of the Ivory Coast The word TA in the Dan language means not only dancing but also singing and instrumental music Practically everything that goes on provides an occasion for dancing Apart from the great final ceremonies that is the burial and funeral rites the most important events are the ceremonies that mark the transition from childhood to full adult status in the community Here now are three drummers playing at a large comingofage festival in the north of the Dan country Several boys are dancing to the rhythm of the drums Two of the drummers come right from right there in the village The chief drummer is not of the Dan tribe but has settled down among them and has built up quite a reputation His instrument consists of a oneskin drum to which he has attached four smaller drums  this OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO way he can play his rhythms at various levels of pitch He begins alone here to be joined after a few measures by theother XII

the uniquely African handpiano and demonstrated its music many times The Dan people have the Mbira  too  known 13 to them as the KOTA A row of metal tongues are attached to a board with a calabash

the same order as the drum we mentioned a while ago in connection with the boys dance When the notes of the mbira are struck the rings will jingle of course Lets have a demonstration of this West

answered by the chorus and then the second sings and is answered and so on 2u5 eason mask races are often held MUSIC CHILDRENS SONG Cut 5 VOICE In the Ivory Coast during the dry 3 among the Dan on market days The best runners compete  some wearing masks and some not The man wearing the mask pursues a young man who tries to escape by dodging between the huts If the runner gets away of course hes the winner but if the masked man catches him then he is the winner Several pairs comoete one after the other and the race is accompanied by music like this MUSIC MASK RACE Cut 6 229 VOICE Music for

songs that play an important role in the cultural  heritage of these people various peoples So off we go to the dancing now on Music Time in Africa  MUSIC THEME 1c SECS UNDER AND OUT  XMXHKMKMXEKMIM Im sure you all agree that dancing makes life worth living Its a form of social recreation that is popular all over the world Theres an almost unlimited number of dances  in Africa that are performed only for th sheer fun and enjoyment 2 of dancing and for the satisfaction of sharing a popular dance dance 4 perhaps the most popular cultural activity among the i  NDAU who live in a region known as Gazaland which stretches from T the eastern border of Rhodesia and across Mozambique The name  Gazaland derives from a legendary hero of the NGUNI peopleoi The effects of NGUNI influence among the NDAU is most evident V  whm  p MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA JULY 18 1976 page 2 3e  j  i not only in the name of their country which they adopted with i I pride but also in the NGUNI name SHANGAAN by which other peoples in Rhodesia call the NDAU Further evidence of NGUNI legacy is I 1  I  the Muchongolo dance itself Actually the NDAU xh call the 5    dance MUCHONGOYO  deriving from the NDAU word chongoyo I meaning stamping ones feet in pain But the elders of Gazaland claim that the dance developed from the NGUNI KIRK war dance called hhe IHUBO  also sometimes called the AMAHUBO mu or the MGUBO They say that in the old days the IHUBO was performed by batallions or regiments of fighting men on ceremonia occasions The songs were meant to be sung by a thousand men or w  more to be really effective sepecially when they are punctuated by the rhythmic stamping of the bare feet that makes the ground shake withihe pcrcussien The IHUBO was a slow stamping dance performed with hKXEKIHEKHKth grandeur by the NGUNI warriors in their military dress Todays MUCHONGOLO is very different A shrill whistle or the slow prolonged blowing of a horn signals g the beginning of the dance This is followed by an explosive cry of voices and a burst of drumming Suddenly the random whistling the shouting and singing join under onefhythmic pattern held an by the drums or just plain handclapping MUSIC CUT ONE 345 r VOICE And that was our first example of the music accompanying the L g famous MUCHONGOLO dance of the NDAU and NGUNI peoples in southern Africa That particular recording was made in the village of Maniza just north of MAPUTU and performed by a h group of RONGA men but here now is a large group of NDAU dancers dancing and singing the MUCHONGOLO to the compl rhythms of xx three

previously that todays MUCHONGOLO dance actually CUT TWO developed from the old regimenntal dances of the NGUNI in which scores of KKKKEXXKX warriors carrying spears and shields would participateo Those were the IHUBO performances in which full regiments of men clad in military dress would compete with each other in displaying their dancing skill And at times girls who were betrothed to the young warriors would also carry spears and shields and join in the singing and dancing The dancers must execute apparently spontaneous movements with perfect unity The greater the element of surprise and spdntaneity the more the acclaim given xxx to the dancers In the old days the igggxxmxn was also performed by large hunting parties on the return from a successful hunt  especially on the occasion of killing a lion or a leopard The dance would take place in inmmmnxmhnxnkmn the presence of the tribal chief who would reward the hunters for their success This next recording is a good example of this type The dancing hunters sing You hear of our famous men  of song we are proud of our fame CUT THEE 502 The IHUBO dance XXXNhXXKKKX performed on the occasion ofa successful lion hunt by a large

AFRICA MAY 9 1976 I page 2 date The Turareg belong to the Muslim faith and traditionally give I i the impression of being a civilization which is withdrawn into itself and where the woman holds pride of place As a matter of fact tttles of nobility and certain rights of ownership are handed down through the maternal line and though it may be exaggerated to speak of a matriarchy the influence of women in the Tuareg society should not beLinderestimated The women are more firmly attached to the traditions of nomad life and offer the strongest resistance to any inclination toward changes The woman therefore is virtually worshipped The TUAREB dedicate  their most beautiful poems and songs to her charms and her virtues There are no professional TUAREG musicians in the proper sense of the wordand music is performed by both men and women but they specialize in quite different types The type of music most frequently practiced by the women is called TINDE  from the name of the drum most often used lhe drum is generally IXMK an ordinary mortar covered with a tanned goatskin attached by cords in which are fixed two long hhhll parallel sticks At each side of the drum a woman sits on the

characterized by the exceptionally lavish ornamentation of the melodic line and the wide range of pitch used Although there are many songs performed by a male vocalist without accompaniment it frequently happens that the singer is accompanied by a woman playing a oneustringed fiddle  the INZAD  a large gourd dried and emptied and covered with goetskin The single cord made of several strands of horsehair is attached at one end to the upper part of the wooden neck and at the other end to small leather straps fixed to the bottom of the neck which also support a flimsy bridge made of two  soundhole criescrossed rods A round Ehxx is cut in the skin near the bridge The bow itself is also made of horsehair tied to both ends of a curved stick EVen though the sounds produced by the INZAD

of material meriting extensive research The rich and varied music can be divided into three parts  one the artistic which consists of classical folkloric and contemporarypopular music  the second is the liturgucal music and the third part is military music Our concern today will be the artistic music of Tunisia REM and Im going to begin with the type of music called MAHLOOF  classical music in

their own improvised works to the basic structure from Spain Whom the music in Tunisia is labelled MAHLOOF this is done to distinguish it from music that is originally oriental  that is music built on the structure of Arabic oh Turkish oriental musics This first recording now is on gsxcsllont example of traditional and classical MAHLOOF music CUT ONE 155 Concerts of classical Arabic music are generally organized as programs XhXhIEEXZEXXXKMliXKhXXKIXhihhx called NUBAh noobah in which instrumental and vocal pieces are linked together and performed in a set pattern The system of programming

Music Time in Africa THEME 10 SECS UNDER AND OUT VOICE Historic Ethiopia consists of the high plateau of the north home of the farmers speaking the demitic languages of Amharie Tigrinya and Tigretigreh Those derive from an old Ethiopic literary language still used in both the Christian and Judaic liturgy EhhiOpian Christianity is deeplyrooted and meticulously obserVed in the whole of the plateau  except for isolated groups of FALASHAS a Judaic sect Successxive Moslem invasions have peopled the south and the east with Cushiticspeaking GALLA pastoralists Even the DANAKIL mining rocksalt in the deserts near the Red Sea are nominally Moslem Along the western border is another group tall darkskhnned Sudanic people living near the BARO River Dozens of small farming tribes of the

tiny Semitic speaking enclave in a vast Cushiticspeaking area Unlike the other Ethiopian Semiticspeakers however the ADARES are neither Christians nor Jews but are strict Moslems Their language their costumes and some of their regligious obseriances are distinctive but their music is most distinctive of all for nowhere else in Ethiopia is this type of indigenous polyphony that is the singing of several melodies together to be found Two young ADAREH adareh girls sing ghhhhhg love song in the distinctive oldstyle typical of this region CUT ONE 220 An oldstyle love song of the ADARES who live

ANUAK and the NUER it is called TOUM  a small wooden box with metal keys that are plucked with both thumbs Often one hears the term thumbpiano in describing the instrument In Ethiopia this charming instrument is used almost entirely for love songs for which its delicate tone is eminently syitable In this recording a youth of the ANUAK tribe from the village of GAMBELA plays the toum in

program is Music Time in octcber 12 1975  15 secs PAUSE  0 Africa for breadcast on 5unday am Its Mudic Time in Africa  THEM 15 SECS UNDER AND OUT Hello there Im Sue Moran and this is our weekly music show featuring some of Africas finest musicians and cultural groups performing both traditional and popular African music Im so glad youre Joining me today friends This will be the second part of two special programs on the music of the JOS Plateau region in the Federal Republic of Nigeria Last week I had recordings of the BIRCH ANGAS JARAWA and PYEM people who live in the Plateau region and today itll be music of the YERGAM and BURUM who also inhabit the same area in central Nigerial So stay with me now for Music Time inifrica 10 SECS UNDER AND OUT Id like to KEEIKX First before I begin with todays recordings simply recall that the J03 Plateau where the recordings were made is mn the center of Nigeria and rises to an average height of 1290 meters It makes up the ncrthern extreme of BENPLATEAU state one of the 12 states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria There are about no or so tribes and subtribes of various origins each possessing its own language and traditions Known history of  r the YERGAM and BURUM dates back to the 13th and luth centuries but it was during the 16th and 17th centuries that they were part of the famous JUKUN Empire Im starting off todays program with traditional music of the Yergam from the village of ZUNGZUHG The YERGAM tell the story of a man who disappears from the village n  Wwlrvlvwu V2 we mm 5 m m in  v rw  Oct 12 1975MUSIC VOICE QUS GOVERNMENY PRXNTING OFHCE 1573498271 MUSIC VOICE w  I    38  taken away by the water spirits Some time later he returns and begins to sing obviously inspired This new power called KbMTIN cones from aquatic spirits in whom they perceive the real creators of the music The KbMTIN style of music is essentially choral and polyphonic In this recording a dozen men and women divide themselves into several sections between which the vocal parts are distributed A male sclist improvises variations and after a change of rhythm a new melody appears stated in unison but soon i superimposed with a variation sung by the women he members of the group play various percussion instruments  halfcalabashes called IKPANGIdHIR and grainfilled calabash rattles known as AKISHAK CUT ONE IKERK 355 h Like most of the other tribes on the JOS Plateau the YERGAM uses the MOLD raft zither frquently in their music Made entirely from reed the instruments usually have five groups of three strings The ensemble in this next recording consists of two MOLD zithers a bowharp a bottle hit with a metal rod and a dry vegetable pod used as a rattle The singer and leader of the group plays one of the raft zithers The idea of getting together a nnxs MOLO orchestra is an inovation the instrument being traditionally used alone by one or several singers the orchestra in this number is certainly a result of a new situation where some musicians are becoming more professional and where their audience is no longer limited to a single village CUT Two W 1430 Music of the YERGAM by a MOLO raftzither orchestra recorded in the village of LANGRANG Stillbiggsr than the orchestra you just heard this following selection is played by an ensemble of four ti musicians is quite rare even unique 134438271  g 0 at r E keg  Adm 1 3 s MUSIC s V VOICE U raftzithers a harp a bottle a pair of KATAKO castanets and a zither shaken in the same way as a rattle A total of eight  but here its a family affair the orchestra being made up of brothers and wives of the  lead singer One of the wivesp1ays the harp an instrument WW normally reserved for men In this song ZHIMAK TYEM congratulates the people present including a district official whom he asks to In serve the ppople well begs the visitors to take greetings to JOS introduces his wives and encourages them to play loudly and with feeling so that he will earn enough to feed them CUT THREE 210 The BURUM present neighbors of the YERGAM say they originated from the JUKUN of which they would have been a branch or vassal tribe Like the renew the BURUM were also a part of the JUKUN ts Empire during the 16th and 17th centuries and share the same type of existence as the other Plateau peoples  an essentially ts agricultural economy with a few handicrafts  pottery basket weaving and forging Their music style is very marked by IIIE making the HAUSA influence as much by the melody and rhythm as by the E instruments themselves I have two Very good examples of BURUM a music here  the first is a number called WASAM BURUM meaning t the BURUM play has an entertainment dance for evaryone One QM musician hits a shoulderslung drum with his open hand and another on the ground with a curved drumstick A third drum is played by another musician Coming in different sizes these cylindrical drums are all called GANGA  a HAUSA term CUT FOUR 308 This second example of BURUM music is like the recording you Just Its title  KIDA MANOMA  means heard an entertainment dance n7 sg9 rnsic TIME IN AFRICA OCT 12 1975 page h i a  9 music for the agriculturists and is sung in HAUSA Two we  monochord riddles three small hourglassshaped drums and a big   GANGA drum accompany the singing t Vx  MUSIC CUT FIVE 2h5 we   VOICE That was music of the BURUM people on the JOS Plateau in central C  Nigeria Ive chosen as my final selection today another 5 recording of YERGAM music  an excellent example of dance music e performed by a whistleflute ensemble for a harvest celebration 7 this type of music in the YERGAM language is called IZUR NFIKO  Lg IZUR meaning whistle flute and NFIKO meaning harvest An ensemble generally comprises a dozen whistle flutes made from reeds of M different lenght  between about ten and thirty centimeters   m pg without lateral holes and held vertically between the thumb and r index finger The IZUR are carefully tuned with each other each 3 giving a sound corresponding to its lenght The musicians come in R 3 in the ensemble in rapid succession and in a precise order Besides whistleflutes in this recording the group also includes a large ga barrgll drum hit with a curved drum stick a metallic gong in V f form hit with an iron rod and a rattle made from a halfcalabash v MUSIC CUT SIX 500 VOICE Music from the JCS Plateau Region in

recordings Ive selected for today feature the traditional musical instruments and vocal styles of the SONGHAI people in Vi the Republic of MALI in West Africa Along the great bend of the NIGER River where it touches the edge of the Sahara desert KKKHXI live the SONGHAI one of the large number of ethnic groups that make up Malis varied population The SONGHAI first appeared in history when ruled by an ancient Berber dynasty driven south by Arab conquest In the year 1009 the city of GAO on theNiger became the capital and administrative center for the Songhai and also at about this time began their conversion to Islam Written history about the SONGHAI appears in manuscripts by two historians living in TIMBUCTU during the 17th century IMXHMHXMKMEX In their songs are the tales andi JMUSIC TIME IN AFRICA i l gmusxc 3w fvoxca i xx JUNE 1 1975 page two legends of ancient battles of the heroic dees and exploits of the Songhai warriors Even today we canstill hear abOut these ancient legends in the verses sung by Songhai musicians This first recording of Songhai music takes us back to the time of the ruling PASHAS of TIMBUKTU The song is about the OULAD HXSSAN a family of aristocrats who have their descendants at TIMBUKTU still today M 305 The name of that song was TANDINA about an aristocratic Songhai CUT ONE family that lived in TIMBUKTU several hundred years ago and today a  there are still descendants of IE2 family in that town Here now is a recording made in TIMBUKTU and is typical of the Moorish a style of music in that region The song is about a certain tree fa MUSIC VOICE that symbolizes the love the Moors have for their country It is sung on the occasion of festivities and vigils around the drum In the course of the singing more and more verses are improvised by the guests 3zu5 The musical instrument that dominates the music of the Songhai is CUT TWO the African lute It has three main strings although sometimes four and is similar to the TIDINIT of the Moorish griots in Mauretainia the KONNIkohnee of the Mandingo the HALAMhahlahm of the Wolof and the same as the lutes found among other peoples of West Africa Its a wooden soundbox with a skin stretched over it The neck of the instrument is a wooden stick fixed into the soundbox under the skin and the strings are stetched over a bridge up to the tip of the wooden pole The most characteristic thing about the instrument is the method of playing it  the musician simultaneously taps the stretched skin of the soundboxI MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA lIo MUSIC VOICE JUNE 1 1975 page three with his right thumb while playing to mark rhythm Just like the M core of Mauretania the Songhai reserve the playing of the lite for men only A good example of Songhai virtuosity in lute playing is this dance song recorded in the village of ANSONGO about 65 miles or 100 kilometers south of the city of GAO on the N iger It demonstrates not only the excellent finger technique I that can be attained on the lute but also the technique of tapping the soundbox for rhythmic accompaniment Its music mini for the TAKAMBA dance of the Songhai F CUT THREE 316 The TAKAMBA dance of the Songhai played as a solo on the African If lute It is this very same TAKAMBA dance that is considered to be p the principal cause of Songhai music undergoing a process of modernxization during the past decade Its a most popular and  favorite dance that originated in the village of TAKAMBA near rm MUSIC VOICE     v M the town of BOUREM Just north of GAO on the NIGER This next selection is a very old Songhai folk song that has become one of the most famous TAKAMBA tunes suhg by the fashionable griots uz30 Another old folk tune that has been handed down through the CUT FOUR generations by the griot famihes among the Songhai is the song  A y  HADYZA  a girls name in Arabic  sometimes pronounced HADIJA   r or KHADIJA as in North Africa or the Middle East fhe song which has also become a TAMBAKA dance tune is dedicated to a young Arabian girl so beautiful that her renown spread beyond the I song for you J borders of her native country The singer says1 usage TIME IN AFRICA JUNE 1 1975 page four  a I 95 HADEYZAt Oh you ladies of great

probably the most popular of all the TAKAMBA dance songs  its a must at practically every gay soiree among all the Songhai The title wahono  meaning curdled milk one of the favorite dishes of the f

four major cultural subgroupings The first subgroup consists of the plateau peoples who are mainly farmers The second subgroup are the people of the east coast regions whose main sources of Illill livelihood are fishing and farmingb The third division lives in the savannah of the centralwestern semidesert regions These people are the islands chief cattleraisers The fourth and last subgroup are

course it has its own peculiarities of dialect wellmixed with words from the Bantu Swahili Arabic English and French Throughout the island there are three main types of performance by traditional musicians  the singing of bardic songs music for ceremonies and funeral music These performances are the business of music specialists who have a u particular and important function in their various communities The l bard for example receives special status amonng the various peoples  in the high plated region Ceremonial musicians are in great demand for various ritual occasions and they always play in troupes Our a musical visit in the Malagasy Republic begins on the East Coast  probably the most scenic part of the country and where there is an abundance of coffee Here the folk songs reflect the daily work of the coffee growers the raising and the harvesting the sorting and the husking and the dancing after the work is finished In this first recording we have a medley of songs accompanying all the activities of coffee production in the east region of the island CUT ONE hzho Malagasy music from the east coast of the island  it was a medley of songs for coffeeraising for the harvesting and sorting and the husking of the coffee beans in the mortars and finally the music for the end of the days work and dancing Just as the music of the east coast reflects the importance of coffeeraising the music of the West Coast portrays the busy life of the fishermen This next selection begins with a song about the fishermen going out to sea in their boats which uptil today still resemble the craft of their distant ancestors The music continues with theJ t 3 up GOVERNMENT PRINTING omc 1913435271 MUIC TIMEIN AFRICA i   Wm   sawm cthmwmmbwiiww  w i J wu  w MAY 25 1975 page three

MUSIC  3 v c  9 01 E MUSIC VOICE MUSIC VOICE CUT TWO 530 Probably the richest variety of types of songs and musical instruments is among the peoples of the High Plateau regions Here one finds the popular VALIHA  the zitherixi type instrument which one usually characterizes with Malagasy music The VALIHA is a bamboo tube with metallic strings stretched along t2 the surfaCe The strings are tuned by small movable bridges under 1  each string Some musicians even use strands of bamboo in place of metallic strings Here now are the lovely sounds of the VALIHA 3 in a solo played by

MUSIC THEME 10 SECS ENEER AND OUT VOICE MUSIC Were going to get into the swing of things right away on todays show withmusic from the KISSI region in western KENYA A group of LUO men sing a gay tune that usually accompanied a LUO folk dance known as BUL and is about a character called BOLO who achbeved an unenviable reputation for having neither shield nor ostrich feathers w these used to be an absolute must in LUO society  especially when one attended a funeral But BOLO was notorious onanother account  he was always showing up at drinking parties uninvitedo A thoroughly unpopular characterall round it seems our ONE 350 The accompanying rhythm in that recording of LUO music from the western region of KENYA was by five BUNDEH bass drums and there was also the sounds of the leg bells called GARA worn by the men performing the BUL danceo Here is a delightful tune new snag a asMUSfC TIME IN AFRICA I  blows Her beauty entranced him MUSIC VOICE MUSIC VOICE MUSIC VOICE MAY 11 1975 page 2 by a group of young LUO girls singing about a woodchoppero The verse goes something like this Tongtong went the woodchoppers axe and there beside him was a girl dancing to the sound of his Tong  TOHn CUT TWO 15 There are many musical instruments scattered throughout KENYA n one canfind all three categories string percussion and wind instrumentso Among the several kinds of string instruments the toohmshort OO THUM is quite popularo Its a lute that was used mostly by troubadors in the old days  an instrument usually used to Khh accompany praise songs The player sits on a pillow or on the ground and furnishes his own percussion by means of bells strung aldng his leg He also has an iron ring on his big toe which he strikes against the musical instrument as it rests on the ground The minstrel playing the THUM in this next recording was from the north NYANZA KK in western Kenya his song is in praise of afriend CUT THREE3OS Now from the south NYANZA region in Kenyas LUO country here is a group of men with a praise song aboutx their country CUT FOUR u15 This next recording was made in the NYANZA region of KENYA about Xx tWentyfive years ago It was recorded in the town of Kapsabet about 50 milesnortheast of KISUMU A group of young NANDI men perform the Moran dance  an attractive dance routine where the dancers link arms in a circle and step sideways to the music while others enter the ring and leap straight up into the I The word yongolo repeated by the chorus does not appear  J to have any meaning and used in songs only for its sound 4 ft or asF  MUSIC VOICE 7  iSIC TIME IN AFRICA MAY 11 1975 page three CUT FIVE 236 The LITUNGU u  short 00 is also one of the more important folk instruments in KENYA Its a kind of lyre that consists of aframework built up around a wooden bowl resonator covered with MUSIC VOICE MUSIC VOICEzl the skin of the giant lizard The number of strings on the LITUNGU varies but 5 7 The traditional method and 8 strings are common of making strings for the LITUNGU was to use cattle tendons but nowadays the strings of tennis rackets are referred An intereSting point about the tuning of the instrument is that if the minstrel is in a merry mood he tends to pitch the instrument highg and if hes feeling pessimistic the pitch is likely to fall The LITUNGU in this next selection is played by a WANGA musician from the northern NYANZA region He leads a group of WANGA men in a historical folksong 236 CUT SIX KmhgMXMEMMHKEXMKEEXEXMKMHXMEMKMKEHMXMXEXK Another musical instrument among the WANGA pedple living in western KENYA is

listening to today and Ive selected recordings aich I think are excellent examples of musical instruments songs and dances of the various ethnic groups of that country So off we go friends for a visit to the Central African Republic with Music Time in Africa 10 SECS UNDER AND 0U Located in the hl center of the African continent the Republic of Central Africa is bordered by the Chari River in the north and by the Ubangi River in the south Dome of the numerous ethnic groups living in the country are the BINGA PYGM ES the LINDA and the BROTO who live in the Bambari Region the NDOKPA of the Grimari Eegion the BAGANDOU the DAKPA ISONGO BOFI and BIANDA and also the AZANDE who are especially noted for The diversity of these ethnic groups which make up the approXimately 2 million inhabitants provides an impressive variety of musical expressions and form about whichglittleis really known Musical instruments in general use are the MBIRA or SANZA handpiano the various types of xylophones harps lutes flutes and rattles Kh wooden horns and whistlesw The Xylophones I find are the most interesting because of the numerous types Central African musicians Ill begin with music played wuww H3

vibrating membrane seals a small opening made in each resonator Players of the KALANGBA use two pairs of mallets a pair a in each hand and strike two keys at a time In this first recording j made in the village of BIADE in the Bambari Region a musician of the LINDA people plays and sings the music for the MBAKEH 3 mbahkeh a festive occasion for rejoicing Young men wearing 3 straw rattles round their ankles dance in a circle one behind the other  I w  MUSIC CUT ONE 307 V  A  VOICE Music of the LINDA of the Central African Republic played on the   KALANGBA a lOnote xylophone The NDOKPA who live in the Grimari Region utilize a type of xylophone not only for music but also for communication Their instrument called the LINGASSIO is a pitxylophone with only four notes It is made by placing over a hole in the ground four slabs of woodon two crossbars made of straw KKKXKKK A single musician strikes the keys with one pair of mallets and reproduces the melody of spoken phrases  the drum language which is known throughout the Central African Republic and in current use for longdistance communications first here is an example of the LINGASSIO being used for drum language  similar toa wooden talking drum 0  MUSIC CUT TWO 010 SEC VOICE At times the LINGASSIO is used in a musical context alternating spoken sentences and purely musical rhythms or phrases as in this next recordingo Two men each with a pair of wallets strike the second keys One plays on a single key while the hthh uses the other three keys The second instrument Which will be heard is a KALANGBAmusic n g MUSIC V01 CE

this dance music one of the LINGASSIO players makes his instrument talk There is a succession of spoken sentences which at times blend with purely musical phrases At one moment for example the musician speaks to the bachelors of the neighborhood Come along bachelors come and dance Let us make the most oflife  d cur THREE 247 a ponimbo V p    Still another type of Xylophone is the KPONIMBO of the AZANDE  played by two musicians facing each other One player has two wooden sticks while the other has only one and they play KIXEEKKXKXV either alternately or simultaneously In this examplerecorded near  BANGUI the capitol city of the Central African Republic two men play a KPONIMBO xylophone that has 33 wooden keys placed on two crossbars made from bananatree trunks The keys are separated by  rods driven vertically into the soft wood of the bananatree trunks l these rods also preyent the keys from slipping sideways when the g I i instrument is playedAccompanying the musicians playing the  KPONIMBO are two other men one playing metal bells called NZORO and the other striking a cylindrical drhm  the GAZA which has El two laced skins The drummer strikes only one of the skins using i one of his hands and a stick in the other  cor FOUR 2a7   p l I v   That was music of the AZANDE in the Central African Republic played on the l3note wooden xylophone called the KPONIMBO Our

VOICES YOUVE RECENTLY RETURNED FROM ANOTHER JOURNEY THROUGH AFRICA HAVENT YOU LEO   VOICE YOU PROBABLY HAVENT GOT OVER YOUR JET LAG AS YET BUT TELL US WHAT COUNTRIES YOU VISITED THIS TIMEI VOICE AND I KNOW YOU BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF MUSIC WHICH WELL BE PLAYING ON FUTURE  MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA PROGRAMS BUT YOU PROMISED ME THAT YOUD HAVE SOME INTERESTING MUSIC FOR OUR LISTENERS TODAY  LEO h I HAVE RITA  WHTA I THINK ARE SOME EXCELLENT EXAMPLES OF XYLOPHONE MUSIC muwwwm I I MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA da 1 JUNE 18 1978 PAGE TWO VOICE I MUSTE CONFESS LEO THAT I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WERE SO MANY DIFFERENT LEO MUSIC VOICEI LEO  TYPES OF XYLOPHONES AND HOW THE INSTRUMENT IS SO WIDELY SPREAD THROUGHOUT I SUBSAHARA AFRICA UNTIL I HEARD SOME OF THE RECORDINGS IN YOUR COLLECTION WELL FROM EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICA UP THROUGH CENTRAL AFRICA AND ACROSS THE CONTINENT THROUGH WEST AFRICA THE TYPES OF XYLOPHONES ARE COUNTLESS  VARYING IN SIZE AND SHAPE  FROM SHELL INSTRUMENTS WITH TWO THREE OR FOUR NOTES UP TO HUGE GIANTSIZED XYLOPHONES THAT REQUIRE SEVERAL MEN TO PLAY ONE IN EAST AFRICA IN THE COUNTRY OF MOZAMBIQUE AND TO BE MORE SPECIFIC THE CHOPI PEOPLE HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE XYLOPHONE THEY ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR KXREE ORCHESTRAS  FROM AS LOW AS FIVE PLAYERS UP 30 GROUPS WITH THIRTY OR MORE LETS PLAY THIS FIRST RECORDING OF A CHOPI ORCHESTRA OF 19 XLOPHONESTHE MUSIC IS JUST AN EXCERPT FROM AN ORCHESTRAL SUITE THATUSUALLY LASTS ABOUT 5 MINUTES CUT ONE 300 XYLOPHONE MUSIC OF THE CHOPI IN MOZAMBIQUE YOU SAID LEO THAT THERE WERE NINETEEN XYLOPHONES IN THAT GROUP THERE MUST BE DIFFERENT TYPE S BECAUSE I COULD HEAR A NUMBER OF GREATLY VARYING TONESI I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THE XYLOPHONE IN MOZAMBIQUE IS CALLED TIMBILA AND THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY FIVE TYPES  THE TREBLE THE ALTO TENOR BASS AND DOUBLEBASS THEXTXMBKX HISTORICAL RECORDS SHOW THAT THE REE CRAFT OF MAKING TIMBILA XYEOPHONES AND THE ART OF GROUP PLAYING HAD ALREADYBEEN WELL ESTABLSSHED BY THE CHOPI AS FAR BACK AS THE EARLY SIXTEENTH CENTURY ALL THE MATERIALS USED IN THE MAKING OF THE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE VARIOUS WOODS THE BEESWAX THE PALMLEAF STRINGS AND THE RESONATORS ARE USUALLY COLLECTED  varnz mm  6 H 3 C H 5JUNE 18 1978 MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA EAGE THREE WITHIN JUST A FEW MILES OF THE MAKERS VILLAGE EXCEPT FOR A FEW SIMPLE Ga CARPENTERS TOOLS EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TIMBILA ea COMES FROM RIGHT CLOSE BY AND ALL THE RAW MATERIALS ARE PROCESSED AND PUT    r RITA LEO RITA  LEO TOGETHER BY THE VILLAGE CRAFTEMEN  m ITS AMAZING LEO HOW THE INSTRUMENT MAKERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO SELECT THE RIGHT KIND OF WOOD THE QUESTION IS HOW DID THEY COME BY THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE 5 MUSIcAL PROPERTIES OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WOOD WAS IT BY SHEER ACCIDENT OR BY 3 OBSERVATIONAND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 5 WELL I GUESS THAT THE ONLY CONCLUSION WE CAN COME TO IS THAT THE CRAFTSMANSHIP   A CR 0F AFRICAN INSTRUMENTMAKERS MUST HAVE BEEN PERFECTED OVER MANY MANY CENTURIES AND THAT EACH GENERATION HAS HANDED DOWN ITS SECRETS BY PERSONAL INSTRUCTION a YOURE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY AMZAING BECAUSE WHEN A CHOPI MDSICIAN PICKS A CERTAIN HARDWOOD FOR THE NOTES OF HIS XYLOPHONE IT SEEMS NOT ONLY To BE THE REST i BEST IHXIHNEEIIEEXAREI BUT THE ONLY REVEREERATING WOOD ON ANY QUALITY IN THE 5 WHOLE AREA THE INSTRUMENTMAKERS HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED SUCH THINGS THAT THE W 1 FEMALE SPECIES OF A PARTICULAR TREE IS MORE RESONANT THAN THE MALE AND THAT THE  MOST MUSICALLY EFFECTIVE PART OF ANOTHER TREE IS THE ROOT IT IS AMEXINGI g WELL WERE READY FOR MORE TIMBILA MUSIC WHAT IS THE NEXT RECORDING YOU HAVE 3 HERE I 7  E3 THIS IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF AN ORCHEsTRAL INTRODUCTION BY A MASTER CRAFTSMAN AND 3 COMPOSER  KOMUKOMO I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THIS FAMOUS HDSICIAN STILL LIVES 6 OR NOT

THAT THE PIECE OF MUSIC WE JUST LISTENED T0 WES THE FIRST PART OF A DANCE SUITE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE IN THE FIRST PLACE CHOPI XYDOPHONEE MUSIC IS ONE OF THE MOST ELABORATE TYPES OF AFRICAN MUSIC ON THE WHOLE CONTINENT ACTUAL ORCHESTRAL SUITES ARE COMPOSED COMPLETE AND DETAILED  AND NOT ONE NOTE OF THE MUSIC WRITTEN DOWN CHOPI ORCHESTRAL DANCES ARE COMPLETE DANCE SHOWS THE AND THEENTIRE PIECE IS KNOWN AS NGODO AND CONSLSB OF FROM NINE TO ELEVEN SEPARATE MOVEMENTS USUALLY A WHOLE PERFORMANCE LASTS ABOUT FORTYFIVES MINUTES OR MORE SP YOU SEE THERES NOTHING TRIVIAL ABOUT THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT EVEN MORE REMARKARLE IS THE FACT THAT NEW ORCHESTRAL DANCE SUITES ARE COMPOSED EVERY TWO YEARS OR SO AS IN EVERY FORM OF ART  MUSIC OR ANYTHING ELSE  THE SAME DEGREE OF BRINLLIANCE ISNT ACHIEVED BY EVERYONE NOR IS IT EASILY COME BY IVE LEARNED LEO THAT THE CHOPI SAY TO PLAY THE TIMBILA YOU MUST DREAM ABOUTJT AND NOT ONLY MUST YOU PRACTICE FAITHFULLY BUT YOU MUST START YOUNG THE CHOPI ALSO SAY THAT NO PLAYER WHO TOOK UP THE XYLOPHONE LATER TERI THAN HIS TEENS EVER BECAME A REALLY GOOD PLAYER I HAVE ENE MORE EXAMPLE OF CHOPI MUSIC m  53 um 9i 4 A  3  n 2 2 v xr MUSIC RITA LEO MUSIC

cultures of the equatbrial forest Among the numerous types of instruments in the traditional music of the FANG the most important are the MVET the NGOMBI and the xylophones which vary greatly in size shape and the number of keys In this recording of cult music of the FANG the xylophone called MELANE mehlaneh has nineteen keys Its made of two crosspieces of bananatree trunks resting on the ground

Sarkisian our musicologist in residence Its Music Time in Africa MUSIC THEME 10 SECS UNDER AND OUT VOICE Our music today comes from one of the old known countries in the world Ethiopia Ethiopias long and uninterrupted history dates back to about 1000 BC and still retains its rich cultural Elsibi traditions  especially in the music and dances of the many ethnic groups in the country The earliest traditions of  religious dances go back to Old Testament times During church services or at inIIKXMXKMIgIMhHXHKi religious festivals specially trained priests perform sacred dances to the accompaniment of the drum and sistra AlmOSt every festive occasion like birth marriage harvest or a patriotic celebration is an occasion and for dancing Ksinging dignified of the stringed instruments A delightful old world instrument it Traditional musical instruments are still being used in their original form The BEGANA the Ethiopian lyre is the most important and resembles the lyre of the Greeeks and the Romans and is believed to be exactly like the legendary harp of David It has eight to twelve strings that are plucked with the fingers The body is usually shaped like a section cut out of a pyramid or occasionally it may be bowlshaped covered with skin or parchment stretched over its open front Two other important stringed instruments used by Ethiopian musicians are the MASENKO and the MRAR The MASENKO a violintype of instrument is the only bowed musical instrument in EZEEEXK Ethiopia It has a diamondshaped wooden body covered with skin or parchment and a single string made of severalIQTIME IN AFKECA JUNE 1977 Page two strands of horsehair The bow is arcshaped and strung with thickly stranded horsehair The player of the MASENKO is found everywhere  there is hardly a village where he is not to be seen and his usual role is to accompany a song in solo or chorus The other important instrument is the KRAR  a sixstringed KKK lyre also plucked with the fingers or a plectrum The body is like a shallow bowl hollowed out of woodor merely a tin box 0n the front it is covered with skin stretched by a wire and a second piece of skin covers the underside and also stretched with a piece of wire Out of the box or body two arms of the instrument protude at an angle away from each other A crossbar at the top joins the two arms forming a triangle The strings are attached to the erodebar and stretched over a bridge on the skin of the bowllfboth the MASENKO and the KRAR as well as the BEGANA are accompanied by flutes and drums in this selection based on old folk tunes played during wedding ceremonies The song titled My wedding day describes the brides feelings as she leaves her parents home to start a new life with her husband  SIC cur ONE M07 ICE The same group of

used in Ethiopia the WASHINT and the L H EMBILTA are the most important and the most popular The WASHINT is a simple In t flute made from a length of bamboo cane It has usually four KHIKK finger   holes The top of the instrument is cut open as a mouthpiece forming a right  angle with 1K1 a thin lower edge This sets the air column in the flute  vibrating It is entirely secular in use generally accompanying other musical instruments percussion or stringed in a choral or solo song or a dance It plays an imprtant role in an orchestra of Ethiopian instruments in as much as other stringed instruments are tuned to it The EMBIHTA is a larger though more fr primitive type of WASHINT It has no fingerholes The mouthpiece is Ushaped and V formed by the removal of a slice of bamboo for about onethird the width of the bore of the pipe Like the WASHINT the EMBILTA is held at a downward angle away from the body to the 3 players right The EMBILTAs are played in groups of ihlx three Each

Islamic Republic of Mauretania  recordings collected by our Musicman Ieo Sarkisian during a visit to NOUAECHOTT capital of Mauretania The music will be traditional songs performed by the leading professional musicians of the country So once again friends join me for Music Time in Africa MUSIC THEME 10 SECS UNDER AND OUT  VOICE The exotic music of Mauretania is based on an extremely intricate and complex musical theory  especially the techniques of playing the indigenous musical instruments Musicians in Mauretania are professionals who form their own special category in the Moorish society and are commonly known as GRIOTS greeohs just as the folk musicians throughout Vest Africa are called This includes both both men and women The techniques of their craft especially the instrumental techniques are handed down from generation to generation  orally of course The two main instruments played by the Moorish griots are the Ardin and the Tidinit The Ardin is a harpplayed by the Moorish women griots It usually has ten strings but this number varies frequently Traditionally the Tidinit a fourstring lute is reserved for the male musicians Similar to the KONNI of Mali and Guinea and the Halam of Senegal the Tidinit of Mauretania is a long narrow wooden sound box with a skin stretched over it The neck of the instrument is simply a wooden stick a pole fixed into the soundbox under the skin The strings are stretched over a bridge and fixed at one end to the tip of its the neck and at the other end to leather rings round the neck proper The strings are tuned by moving XEEXIKEIKKX the leather rings IKEXIIEIXIIXKEIK The  Tidinit sounds like this MLSIC cur ONE 0157MUSIC TIME IN AFRICA JUN 1977 page two 3 3 L n Lh VOICE Most musicians usually add small bells to the tip of the neck pole or even small 5 metal chains that rattle while the musician is playing But probably the most 5 r characteristic thing about the instrument is the method of playing  that is F the musician simultaneously taps the stretched skin with his right thumb while  playing to mark the rhythm MUSIC cur TWO 010  VOICE Our first selection now of Mauretanian music is by one of the countrys leading singers and player of the tidinit  CHEIK OULD ABA KIXKXZXIiK a professional griot who performs frequently on local radio W macaw cur mum VOICE Music by CHEIK OULD ABA one of Mauretanias leading musicians As I mentioned 1311 before the two main musical instruments in Mauretania are the TIDINIT and the ARDIN the harp reserved for women The neck of the ARDIN which is more than three feet long is fixed into the half shell of a large calabash used as a resonator The resonator is covered with a taut skin and the strings run perpendicular to it The strings are fixed to pegs placed at 3 various levels 1 US GOVERNMENT PRENYINC OFFICE 19659699 and at regular intervals along the neck pole The resonator of course If r T x amplifies the sounds of the vibrating strings and often the Ardin player may stop playing the strings and simply tap the skin covering the resonator like a V drum Often the Ardin is played in as accompaniment along with the Tidinit which Q plays the leading role This next recording is an excerpt from a rather long classical piece of music but IIXEKKK is a very good example of instrumental technique and vocal style Its performed by a 311 popular woman griot who also is a local radio star 8 NEYMAMINT CHOUEIKH msxmcurmwucmwo FOUR 50g 4  VOICE Music of the Moors by one of Mauretanias leading singers NEYMAMINT CHOQEIKH  1 x L I There are three principal styles in Moorish classical music and all three are based on an extremely intricate musical system The first style is known as I I d   LEKHAL meaning black The second style is white  called LEBIADH and the2 U 5 GOVERNMENT WNNTING OFFICE 1976596995 r x 41 l  yUSIC TIME IN AFRICA MUSIC VOICE JUN 1977 page three u 33 third is called ZRAG meaning the spotted style Each of these styles or ways of playing has its own sequence of different modes A mode in Moorish  music is fairly close to the Western idea of a mode though not exactly in the f same scope It is often difficult to determine the actual mode in which a piece of music is being played There are at least four principal modes within each of the three styles of music The modes are known as KARR VAGHD SlNTMA and BldI Now here is where it begins to get a little more complex The name of a mode changes  depending in which style it is played For example if the mode KARR is played in the black style its called NTEMASS while in the white style the KARR mode would be called MEKKEMUSA And in the third style  the spotted style the KARR mode would be called NOUFEL Actually each mode or scale in Moorish music is characterized not only by its particular musical contents but also by the circumstances themes and moods xxx with which it is conventionally connected What I mean by this is 21 for example that the mode KARE is linked with the idea of gladness and joy the mode VAGHO with the theme of war and courage strength and pride 1X1 the mode SEINIMA is associated with more complex black and white styles and the BEIGI mode is connected with nostalgia melancholy or lament I think these thingshat Ive 3311 said about Moorish music shows the rxnxxxxxx cultural richness which exists in African traditional music A we11known virtuoso on the TIDINIT and fammus Moorish singer is SIDI AHMED EL BAKAY buckeye OULD ANA and in this recording he performs in the sINI KARE mode in the black style CUTWSGGWI FIVE 2315 That was music in the black style and played in the SEINI KARR mode Now here is an excerpt from a concert of MboriSh music which begins as is the custom with a sort of instrumental introduction during which the griot adjusts the tuning of the instrument getting into the mood of the chosen mode IKHXKKIKEKIIEX The musician in this EXXB performance is a celebrated griot from the town of MEDERDRA and he plays and sings in the VAGHO mode  which I explained as theBIC TIME IN AFRICA JUN 19 page four 3 mode with the themem of war courage streggth and pride BIC CUI WISE SIX M30  IOICE The words of the songs youve been listening to by the way are not imprhvised but learned and memorized Its very rare that a griot would improvise as he sings along Actually these musicians can develop a whole song from just a few verses prolong a syllable or even confine himself 1 to the repitition of a very hrief phrase This is reflected in the next recording which was made in 0 desert camp of the EMIR of TAGANT 331 in the central part of the country Severil of the EMIRs musicians perform war music and as I explained before the music must be played in the VAGHO mode SIC CUT EIIE SEVEN 5135 DICE I hope youve enjoyed listening to the

to be immersed in water before playing or the reeds elseXXXX would not have produced any sound There are similar pipe groups in MALAWI except we find that the pipes are made of Varyinglength sections

BOTSWANA It features 19 pipes made of copper tubing  each pipe tuned by means of plugs at the end of each tube The tuning varies from performance to performance and the pitch of the instrument can be varied by the player both by the position of the lips and tongue over the mouthpiece and by the force of wind especially noticeable in the higherpitched pipes In the performance of this particular dance in this recording the dancers walk round sideways in a circle using a simple stamping step CUT SEVEN 222 The extremely rich and varied music of the EKKIXKIXIIillih MAMEUTI pygmies who republic

cracking of the wooden pipes they are often encased in the skin of a wild pigs tail shrunk onto the hollowed pipe while still wet This recording starts with the sound of the MAMBUTI pygmy hunting pipes with which they call to each other in the forest while hunting Instaniiy at the sound of these pipes the pygmy hunters lift up their heads and begin yodelling or singing other notes far more powerful than one would expect from so small people The hunting call in this rrcotding is followed by a dance tune by an ensemble of 10 pipes accompanied by two laced drums and rattles 310 TR125 A8921

called VIYANZI has a mouthpiece cut at a double angle the shorter side being pressed to the lower lip In this group the pipes have been tuned to obtain a pentatonic scale in a total range of about two octaves The players stand ina circle and follow each others pipes  starting to play by beginning with the pipe third from the lowest pitch Each pipe above then takes his rhythm from the next man below If one fails to get started he holds up all the others above The leader then comes along and gets his rhythm for him and his companions can then take up the rhythm until they are finally joined by the

kingdoms Probably the most qouted siurce of information is a book called A history of Dahomey  written and published in the 18th century One of the reasons for so many written accounts of life in this part of the African continent ii is that the coast of DAHOMEY was of major importance at that time It was the chief center for the slave trade of the 17th and 18th centuries and during the 18th century a large number of kingdoms existed As the slave trade developed along the coast a rivalries among the Kings increased  all resulting in political disorder for many years The longlived Kings of

th5m35vs Traditional musical expressions songs and dances all of which play an important part in their lives are still preserved unchanged and performed perhaps as they were in the past for generations The xylophones of the LOBi are famous in West Africa chiefly because of their exceptionally large size compared to those from other West Africa countries like Guinea Mali Senegal Gambia or Sierra Leone LOBI xylophones called ELONG have giantsize gourd resonators under each wooden Inn key and the materials used by the expert instrument makers to manufact ure the instruments nxaiix uSually are collected locally  probably no more than 25 or 50 miles from the iIIIKEX makers village The high degree of craftsmanship of the makers has been perfected of course through the centuries the secret knowledge of selecting the highest quality rare reverberating woods has been handed down from generation to generation just as the art of playing is taught hy the master musician to his son

country It was recorded by Radio BoboDjialaasso jalahso and collected by our musicman Leo Sarkisian during one of his visits to that part of the country  cur ONE 67 The xylophones of the LOBI people in southwest Upper Volta I believe the one thing that shows the real genius of the African instrument maker is his method  and knowledge of selecting the various materials that will give the best tone and resonance to whichever instrument he makes In the case of the xylophone besides knowing which woods are of the highest quality of reverberation the maker has the remarkable ability of selecting certain gourd resonators which are fastened beneath each wooden key For as each wood slab is tuned to fit into the scale it has to be resonated by a gourd at exactly the same frequency of vibration  The art of tuning each wooden key also requires the highest skill and craftsmanship Notice the resonance of the xylophones in this next recording played by the same Illf1u group of LDBI musicians of

lf Youve listened to music of the LOBI and the DYAN of Upper Volta I mentioned earlier that the Sembla XXIX like the LOBI are also noted for their xylophone orchestras and their expert playing They take part frequently in national celebratdons alongside their LOBI neighbors and the festivities are never complete unless the SEMBLA are called upon to perform their 53 most popular dance 331131 known as Song of the Masks You will notice in this recording that as the dance progresses there is an increase in the tempo as the excitement of the whole affair rises to a pitch cur FIVE L 15 I have time for one more selection of SEMBLA music by a xylophone orchestra which shows not only the virtuosity of the musicians but also the beautiful resonant tones produced on the carefully tuned wooden keys The sounds of the bass notes mingling with those of the tenor and alto and the tinkling of the high notes all add to the excitement of listening to a xylophone orchestra Even the rattling of the

past remains In Norocco custom is everywhereEach people 9  population of morocco is made 52 up of two main ethnic groups  Berbers and Arabs pa has its own customs and traditions related to every aspect of life The Because of their close releationship and RIKKKIXIIEB kinship ties Arabs and Barbers have much in common the main distinction between then being only a I a linguistic one The original inhabitants of the country were Barbers a r mountain people divided intosevera1 subgroups Each EidplXXi group has its ggg own form of the common language especially noticeable in their oral traditions  Their main creative activity is the dance and its accompanying syncopated music  esh tribal group has its own dances performed during marriages harvesttime circumcision ceremonies and any other festive occasion providing an excuse for dancing In the High Atlas mountain region the most fully developed traditional dance is the AIWASH It consists of both song and dance and on account of its complexity it is often called Berber Opera Its a collective dance and the number of people participating depends on the importance of theE festive occasion with sometimes more than 200 dancers

more composed and restrained than the AHWASH dance of the High Atlas Barbers with most of the aggressive rhythms absent in the performance In the AHZUJU dance songs play a much greater role They are

of View is the LUBA of the KATANGA and KASAI regions in the southeastern part of Zaire Both archeological and linguistic evidence point to LUBA country as a region with an old established civilization Ihe result of excavations along the empire of considerable wealth and dimensions Much of the information about migrations and invasions by various peoples during the 15th and 16th centuries in the regions of ANGOLA and ZAIRE are based on traditional oral history but written llll documentary information describing in detail about LUBA traditic  appeared about the middle of the 16th centuryOne of the earlie states in Central Africa to be remembered was that of theI V a s  Music TIME IN AFRICA MUSIC VOICE page 2 KALUNDWE on the LUBILASH river This state was infiltrated and then conquered by a people from the north called the SONGYE The SONGYE KIRK established a powerful empire in KATANGA that spread over a wide area and probably survived for several centuries The decline and overthrow of the SONGYE empire caused much turbulence and longdistance migrations which finally resulted in the establishndnt of the LUBA empire According to new documentary evidence this took place sometime between the lhth and 15th centuries I mentioned earlier that much of what we know about the LUBA has been based on oral IKXHXIXKKI history and as you know traditional music plays an important role in oral history As memories of the older historians are orally passed down from generation to generation so ta3the legendsxnn the genealogic and lineage histories and other statements of origin and geographical data transmitted in the verses of IHKXXKIX songs by folk musicians and itinerant troubadors In this first recording a Luba music we hear a large choral group performing a composition x

around the northern western and southern shores of Lake Victoria    e  q r Ethnographicaliy one of the most famous among these states was 5 BUGANDA It was perhaps the largest and the most powerful kingdom 1 4  state at the time of the arrival of Europeans and characterized 5 by territorial rule of a paramount ruler chosen from among the I members of a roal kinship group By the 18th century Buganda had 1 I taken Soaps and had begun a period of expansion and by the end of 5 the 18th centrcy the ruler of Buganda the KABAKA had as sufficiently subdued a number of neighboring kingdoms It took many campaigns and constant journeys for the reigning KABAKA to  quell rebellion and to keep the kingdom together but the KABAKA continued to strengthen BUGAHDA by rewarding loyalty with favors ordering exacutions transferring subordinate subchiefs dividing  1 x  i u 0 TIME 17 AFRICA page 2 districts and contracting marriages of convenience Actually the word BUGANDA means the same as UGANDA which is a KISWAHILI word meaning the country of the GANDA people Coastal Kiswehili was the language of trade and exploration and the destination of traders and cxlorers was the land of the KABAKA

was the heart of the state With the Kabaka at his palace were his court his officials and chiefs and subchiefs who paid tribute and received orders The capital of the Kabaka which moved from hilltop to hilltop for administrative and political reasons always remained in the vicinity of Kanpala which of course is the capital of Uganda today Music musical instruments and selfadornment were the most notable forms of traditional artistic expression ihe GANDA were always considered to be the best drum carvers and the most important and elaborate drums were the royal drums executed by skilled

century the FULANI were located not only in FUTA and MACINA but small groups were scattered throughout the interiors from the Senegal River to the Cameroons But elements of the FULANI had already reached HAUSALAND probably g3 early as the 13th century The FULANI were briginally conservative cattle traders and although they reached some agreement with the dominant7 agriculturists among whom they lived they held aloof from their culture Because of this the FULANI retained their Caucasihn dharacteristics even after hundreds of years of association with The music of the FULANI is as rich

off we go now to the northwestern and central regions of Tanzania for Noelo Time in Africe THEME 10 SECS CEDEE AND OUT Since the time written hietory opens in the area around Lake Victoria and without doubt for some considerable time before that there had been kingdom states around the northern western one southern shores of Lake Victoria As we take a closer look at writtn history we learn that in the early 18th century SUKUMA chiefdoms were located 15 the area immediately south of Lake Victoria which lies in KEEXK the northwestern part of todays modern Tanzania KMKXEKKXXX At the some time the NYAMWEZI occupied the territory of the presentmday city of Tabora in central Tanzania The SUKUMA and the NYAMWEZI are very Closely related   linguistically and culturaliyn In both languewes SWKUMA means  north  while the name NYAMWEZ means pecple of the moon The KYAMWEZI groups beginning in the latter 18th century became differentiated largely   A i  U u man m 4 T w  gmusic TIME IN AFRICA because of trade They were the dominant longdistance interior traders participating in the huge trade caravans that travelled in that part of the continent uninto the 19th century As I is mentioned earlier bhth the Sukuma and Nyamwezi have an extensive folklore and rich musical heritage hey haVe a large repertoire of folk dance and songs which shouatheir versatility and  enthusiasm as musicians

example of Nyemwezi music recorded in the TABORA district is of very old Vi origin and was sung for tribal chiefs only on special occasions MUSIC CUT FOUR 505 in VOICE Probably EEK one of the more difficult dance routines among the many traditional dances of the NYAMWEZI is the series known as Mt MANYANGA It requires a great deal of skill because not only are 3 the steps complex but the

OUT SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT 1 CHANGES WHICH I THINK HAVE TAKEN PLACE I THINK NIGERIA IS A PRIME EXAMPLE THAT COUNTRY HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF EUROPEAN CULTURE AND ALTHOUGH ATTITUDES TOWARD WESTERN MUSIC HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT MIXED IT IS QUITE EVIDENT THAT CERTAIN ELEMENTS I HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN NIGERIAN MUSIC AS A RESULT OF THE WESTERN IMPACT IN VIEW OF ALL THIS ONE MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT THE  QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING NOW IS NOT WHETHER NIGERIAN MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGING BUT HOW MUCH AND IN WHAT REPECTS IT HAS CHANGED HTTE WELL I THINK THE QUESTION THAT MOST PEOPLE MIGHT ASK IS WHETHER  ELEO ifM MN AmpLMmmw v  z VOICR  v  r IRLEO  g THESE CHANGES YOU XIX ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE A GOOD THING OR NOT THATS TRUE SPEAKING PERSONALLY I WELCOME THE CHANGES IM STRENGLY IN FAVOR OF THE WAY AFRICAN MUSICAL TRADITIONS ARE CHANGINC TO SUIT CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY I LOOK AT AFRICA WHICH HAS SUCH A GREAT VARIETY OF FORMS OF MUSIC ONE OF THE WORLDS MOST EXCITING MUSICAL AREAS THE MOST STRIRIRO FESTURE OF TRS VARIETY IS THE PRESENCE OF THEOLD AND THENEW AND THE MOST ENCOURAGING FEATURE IS PERHAPS THE FACT THAT IN WEST AFRICA AT LEAST TRADITIONAL STYLES ROT ONLY RLOURISR BUT REMAIN THE PRINCIPAL IRSTRRST OF MOST AFRICANS A WONDERFUL COMPLEX  SIRTRRMXRRSIRRSIURUTSRRXRXTSRTTS MUSICAL CULTURE EXISTS IN WHICH   NRw FORMS ARE SIMPLY ADDED To THE OLD FORMS OF MUSIC WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE MAIN TYPES OF MUSIC BEING PRACTICED IN AFRICA TODAY  2  ID BEGIN wITR TRADITIONAL MUSIC WHICH IS YOU ALREADI KNOW HAS BEEN MY PROME INTEREST THEN THERE IS WHAT RR CALL NEOTRADITIONAL MUSIC THEOTHER TYPES ARE WESTERNIZED POP MUSIC WESTERN POP MUSIC AND LEO I ALSO KNOW THAT YOUVE BEEN INTERESTED AND CONCERNED WITH 53 rm m S D M g C I vvwg m I 3 V L Vim I  f EXISTING SIDE BY SIDE AS N163 C

MOST INDIGENOUS TO THE CULTURES IN AFRICA BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NEOTRADITIONAL EEOTRADITIONAL MUSIC USES NEW MUSICAL FORMS WHICH COME OUT OF TRADITIONAL MUSIC BUT NOT NECESSARELY IN THE SAME CONTEXT OR SETTING AS THEY ARE FOUND IN THE TRADITIONAL CULTURE I GUESS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF EEOTRADITIONAL MUSIC IN NIGERIA ARE THE SOCALLED FOLK OF THE YORUBA IN EIICH TRADITIONAL MUSIC IS PRESENTED OUTSIDE THE SETTING OF SOCIAL CEREMONIES HERE LET ME PLAY THIS RECORDING TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT I MEAN I RECORDED THIS IN THE TOWN OF OSHOGBO NIGERIA ITS PART OF THE LATE DURO LADIPOS YORUBA OPERA EDA  CUT ONE

HAVE To DO THATSHOW AGAIN SOON NOW BACK TO THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EHOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THE WESTERNIZED POP MUSIC Awv YOU MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE TYPES OF MUSIC IN AFRICA TODAY WESTERNIEED POP MUSIC HAS MANY TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS BUT IT ALSO ICONTAINS SOME ELEMENTS OF WESTERN MUSIC AND SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE IN AFRICA AS W STERN POP MUSIC DOES IN THE NESTERN WORLD I BROUGHT ITS A MUSIC IN THIS RECORDING OE NEAT IS KNOWN AS JUJU MUSIC WHICH YORUBA MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE COMBINED WITH THE WESTERN GUITAR OR ACCORDION TEE MELODIC STYLE I THINK IS CLOSER T0 THAT OE WESTERN MUSIC THAN THAT

OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT I CERTAINLY DO RITA COMPOSERS 0F AFRICAN CHURCH FUSIC HAVE INCREASINGLY USED TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS IN THEIR MUSIC AND SDME OF THE MOST EXCITING EXPERIMENTS IN NEGTRADITIONAL MUSIC HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE CHURCH EXAMPLES ARE THE FAMOUS MISSA LUBA OF HYMNS ZAIRE THE GIRMA MASS OF UPPER VOLTA THE KENS OFLTHE WEST AFRICAN SEPARATIST CHURCHS

JANUARY 20 TOBO PAGE Tm OKAY FIRST IM GOING TO PLAY A SHORT HUSTLE OF THE FUSIC I HAVE HERE THEN WELL DISCUSS IT SNEAK IN MUSIC ON IM GOING TO PLAY  CUT TWO 095 SECS MIRMY FAVORITE XYLOPHONES  MUSIC FROM MOZAMBIQUE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SOUND IT CERTAINLY IS A BEAUTIFUL EDUND THAT WAS A TIMBILA ORCHESTRA  A SPECIAL GROUP OF REALLY GREAT MUSICIANS OF THE CHOPI PEOPLE IN MOZAMBIQUE ID LIKE TO BEGIN TALKING ABOUT THIS MUSIC RITA BY FIRSI EEPLAINING THAT XYLOPHONES ARE CALLED TIMBILA BY THE CHOPI AND THAT THE CHBI HAVE BEEN FAMOUS FOR THEIR MUSIC FOR CENTURIES  FfDM ANCIENT TEES THEY PLAY LARGE ORgESIRAsggvOODEN XYLOPHONES AND THEIR ORCHESTRAL DANCES CALLED NGODO AIRWNOST ADVANCED EXAMPLEiOF AFRICAN ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE CONTIEEET FOR TH BENEFIT OF LISTENIRS IN MOTHER PARTS OF AFRICA AND FORM OUR FANS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE OORLD YOU CAN ADD SOME BACKGROUND RITA BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOUVE DONE RESEARCH AND SOLE STUDIES ON THIS AREA WELL PRINCIPALLY THE HOME COUNTRY OF THE CHOPI IS mm A SMALL TRIANGULAR PIECE OF LAME COUNTRY JUST EAST OF THE MOUTH OF THE LIMPOPO RIVER IN THE DISTRICT OF ZAVALA IN MOZAMBIQUE AND AS YOUVE ALREADY SAID LEO THE CHOPI MUSICIANS HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR THEIR LARGE TIMBILA ORCHESTRAS FOR MANY YEARS IN THE PAST ORCHESTRAS WERE TO BE FOUND IN EVERY LARGE VILLAGE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT CHIEFS HAD THEIRM OWN NGODO OF ORCHESTRA AND DANCERS NGODO SOMETIMES PRONOUNCED IGODO INGODO OR MUGODO MEANS THE WHOLE SHOW WHICH INCLUDES BOTH THE DANCERS AND THEPLAYEHS OF THE TIMBILA AND THEIR PERFORMANCE As YOU KNOW THE INSTRUMENTS AMDTHE SONGS AND DANCES REFLECT GREAT CREDIT UPON THE ABILITIES OF THE CHOPI WHEN ONE REMEMBERS THAT NOT A NOTE OF THEIR MUSIC HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN DOWN NOR THE WORDS OF THEIR POETRY WRITTEN OR TRANSLATED IT IS REMARKABLE LEO TO FIND THAT THEY COMPOSED NEW NGODO WITH ALMOST UNFAILING REGULARITY EVERY TWO YEARS OR SO AND AGAIN THE RETDRKABLE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT EACH MOVEMENT IS NEW DISTINCTIVE AND SEPARATE AND MAY LAST FROM A MINUTE ONLY TB UP TO FIVE OR SIX MINUTES EACH THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE TAKES AS A RULE ABOUT FORTYFIVE MINUTES DEPENDING ON THE ROUTINE OF THE HANGERS AND THEMUSIC TIME IN AFRICA 0 LED RITA MUSIC RITA RITA LEO JANUARY 20 1980 PAGE THREE mOD OF THE MOMENT NOT ONLY REHARKEELE BUT YOU GAVE A NICE DESCRIPTION TOO RITA THATS A COMPLIMENT COMING FROM YOU MUSICMAN ILL PLAY x MOTHER PIECE OF NGODO MUSIC RIGHT NOW AND THEN ID LIKE TO HAVE YOU EXPLAIN How A CHOPI COMPOSER SETS ABOUT COHPOSING A NEW ORCHESTRAL DANCE THIS Hm IS JUST AN EXCERPT FROM AN NGODO CUT THREEQ354 I CAN JUSI IMAGINE A WHOLE REGIHENT OF DANCERS iRIING UP THE DUET TO THOSE RHYTHMS AND YOUD BETTER STT STILL LEO YOU CANT HOVE AROUND IN FIDNT OF THE RICROPHONE YOU KNOW THATS BETTER NON ABOUT THE MUSIC  HEEL RITA A DESCRIPTION OF How A CHOPI comm SETS ABOUT COHPOSING A NEW ORCHESTRAL DANCE WILL SHOW How NUSICAIIY ADVANCED CHOPI MUSICIANS HAVE BEEN 3 mmmmmmmnmmm  D 055  ALRIGHT BUT TOW WHAT IS THE FIRST THING THET A CONPUSER ERRED ACTUALLY W HE SETS ABOUT FINDING APPROPRIATE WORDS FOR HIS SONGS AND BEGINS OOHPOSING I AV FWYV VERSES OF THE LYRIC  ALL THIS IS DONE BEFORE W THE MUSIC IN EVERY CASE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE POETRY WHETHER IT BE GAY SAD OR DOCUMENTARY NOULD BE HIGHLY TOPICAL AND APPRORIATE TO THE IDCALITY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY  HIGHLY TOPICAL APPROPRIATE WELL YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE REALLY IN TOUCH WITH VILLAGERS AND THE DISTRICT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE UDRDS OF THE SONGS SONG POEMS WERE OFTEN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THOSE IN AUTHORITY AND TO A DEGREE IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE POEMS REFLECTED THE ATTITUDE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE TOWHRDS THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR SOCIETY GOOD HUMOR WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE IN THE SONGS AS WELL AS SLY DIGS AT PEOPLE WHO NEGLECTED
